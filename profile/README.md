Welcome to **Snout Router**! 🐽

If you're seeing this, you're... kind of early to the party. Eventually there
should be an awesome router implementation here, but I haven't got around to
that part just yet.

In the mean time, you should take a look at [Snout Router Path], which is fairly
complete. It should give you some idea of where this project is headed. Thanks
for stopping by! 👋
